#If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your average time per mile? 
#What is your average speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).

distance_in_miles = 10 * 1.61
time_in_hrs = (43 * 30/60 )/60

average_speed = distance_in_miles / time_in_hrs
print(average_speed)
